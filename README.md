Wrote this as a practice exercise after coming across Project Euler #1 on Hackerrack which seemed to be failing due to loss of precision in javascript with large numbers.

Basic long multiplication implementation, running in O(n^2) time.

TODO:

- Investigate faster multiplication algorithms
e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm
